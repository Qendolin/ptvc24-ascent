## Considered Physics Engines

### Bullet Physics

A lot of negative comments about it's documentation and api design.
Also seemingly not very fast. 
Not actively maintained.

I think ppl just use it because it has a python api, not because it's good.

### PhysX

Very pormising. Industry Standard.
Read a few comments that it's "bloated".
Not quite FOSS.
Probably annoying.

### Jolt Physics

Supported by a AAA game studio. 
Actively maintained. 
Good Multithreading Support. 
Modern c++ API.
Good Documentation.
Also used by Godot.

Most importantly: Easy integration, they provide a fully standalone "Hello World" project.

### Newton Dynamics

Seemd quite promising but Jolt worked before I could check it out.
Actively Maintained. 
Seemingly better than Bullet.

### ReactPhysics3D

Actively maintained. Read a few suggestions for it.
Seems quite good but Jolt worked before I could check it out.

### qu3e

Too simplistic, only supports cube colliders.

### Open Dynamics Engine

Haven't seen many comments about it. Seems professional but I don't know about the performance.
Looked complicated so I didn't investigate further.
